				MATERIALS: one cardboard box

			<div class="steps box1">
				1. Cut a hole in the side of a large cardboard box.The hole should be big enough 
				for your bunny to fit through easily. If you want you can also add more 
				entrances on the other sides. If you have a big enough box, but 
				a smaller box inside the bigger one so your bunny can climb on 
				top of that one or inside it. Put small toys and treats hidden 
				in the smaller box or just in corners. Your bun will love climbing 
				around and exploring his or her new hide-out.
