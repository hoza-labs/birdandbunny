					1. Another way to make a tunnel is to arrange your house 
					so that there are fun places for your bunny to explore. 
					This is often quite simple. All you need to do is move 
					a piece of your furniture about 6-10" (depending on your bunny 
					size) away from the wall. A desk or shelf often works just fine.

					* If you're worried about your bunny chewing your furniture, put small toys in 
					the tunnel so your bun will be distracted from your furniture.
