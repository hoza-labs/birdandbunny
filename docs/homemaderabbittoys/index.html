			<div class="introduction">
				Does your rabbit chew or climb on your furniture? Or rip up your carpet? 
				Or chew wires? It may seem strange, but the solution to a happy house rabbit is toys. 
				Although all rabbits chew, and especially baby rabbits tend to chew execcively, many people think their rabbits 
				"are just chewers" or "have a chewing issue," when often the 
				only issue is that their bunny is bored. A bored bunny 
				is a destructive bunny. Believe it or not, rabbits love to play. 
				They throw things around, chew, dig, and explore. Provide things your bunny is allowed 
				to chew and climb on, and it will play with these, rather than your rug, furniture, or whatever else
				your bunny may enjoy destroying. Toys are expensive, though, and they are 
				often destroyed quite quickly. That's why people make their 
				own toys. Here are some fun ideas to keep your bunny entertained.

				To make the toys on this site, all you need is some bunny-safe 
				rope, cardboard, and paper.
