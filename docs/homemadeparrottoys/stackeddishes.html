				2. Cut several rectangles (or any shape) of cardboard. 
				Size doesn't matter, but I recommend about 3" x 5". Make the 
				cardboard pieces different sizes and shapes. Poke holes in 
				the middle of the pieces of cardboard.

			<div class="steps box1">
				3. Cut a piece of rope about 2 feet long, and tie a knot in 
				one end of it. This rope can be shortened or lengthened depending 
				on how big you want the toy. Then string on one of the egg carton parts and 
				one of the pieces of cardboard. Tie another knot and repeat 
				the process until the toy is as big as you want it. Then use the 
				top part of the rope to tie the toy to the cage.
