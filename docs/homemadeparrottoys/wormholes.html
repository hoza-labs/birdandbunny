			MATERIALS: cardboard, scissors, rope
		</div>
		<div class="steps box1">
			1. Cut a rectangle of cardboard about 3" wide x 5" long. Make 
			the rectangle bigger or smaller depending on how big you want 
			the toy.
		</div>
		<div class="steps box2">
			2. Use a pair of scissors to stab holes in the cardboard. Twist 
			the scissors to make the hole circular and clean-cut. Put holes 
			all over the cardboard, about an inch apart. Put one hole in 
			the center of the cardboard.

		</div>
		<div class="steps box1">
			3. Count how many holes you made and cut that number of pieces of 
			rope, any length. Make the ropes pieces all different sizes. I 
			reccomend somewhere between 7" and 18".
		</div>
		<div class="steps box2">
			4. Tie a knot at the top of each piece of rope. Then thread the 
			pieces through the holes, and tie a knot at the bottom of each 
			piece of rope so they are secured to the cardboard. Have all of the 
			pieces coming out one side of the cardboard with the top knots 
			on the other side, except the middle rope. The middle rope should 
			come out the opposite side. Use this rope to attach the toy to 
			the cage.
