			1. Cut the bottom cup pieces of the egg carton out so that you have 
			some little cups. Using scissors, cut holes in the bottom of the 
			cups. This toy can also be made with paper cups or any other sort 
			of cup. Just make sure whatever you use is bird-safe.

		<div class="steps box2">
			2. Cut a piece of rope about 1 foot long. You can make this 
			rope longer or shorter to make the toy bigger or smaller. A 
			foot of rope makes the toy about 6" long.

		<div class="steps box1">
			3. Tie a knot in the bottom of the piece of rope. Then string 
			one of the cups onto the rope. Tie another knot about an inch 
			above the cup and string another cup onto the rope. Continue 
			doing this until most the rope has cups strung onto it.

			4. Tie the top part of the rope to the cage bars to hang the toy. 
			Then put small treats such as nuts and pieces of fruit in the cups 
			for your bird to discover.
