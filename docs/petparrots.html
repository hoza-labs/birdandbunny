                If you are interested in one of the species above, please
                read a ton more information, because these are very short
                overviews, and to get a real idea for what owning a parrot
                is like, you will need to do lots of research, talk to parrot
                owners, and handle the birds yourself. Parrots are extremely
                 difficult to take care of, and if you are bitten while
                 training one of the larger ones, you are likely to be sent
                 to the E.R. Most people should not own parrots. Please do
                 not get one if you arent CERTAIN you have enough time, money,
                 and determination. Many parrots have the intelligence of a small child,
                 and it breaks my heart when I learn they have been passed
                 through shelters over and over because people thought they could
                 handle one when they really couldnt. Do your research, and if you
                  do have the qualifications, youll have a life-long companion
                  and a wonderful pet. Talk to parrot owners, read all the
                  information you can find (literally), and no matter what,
                  dont get a parrot on impulse. Parrots are amazing, inspiring,
                  comical, and enjoyable pets, but only if you have the time,
                  money, and determination. Good luck!
